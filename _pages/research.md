##### [`Climate Risk and Contract Completeness: Evidence from Corporate Real Estate Leases`](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4686886)

**Presentation: Hitotsubashi 2023, Penn State 2023, FIRS PhD Session 2024 (Scheduled), AREUEA-AsRES 2024 (Scheduled)**

**Presentation: Penn State 2024, IAAE 2024 (Scheduled), Econometric Society Asian Meeting 2024 (Scheduled)**
