**Presentations: Econometric Society Asian Meeting 2024, IAAE 2024, Penn State 2024**

*The difference-in-discontinuities design is a hybrid approach that combines DID and RD. Although the literature states this design identifies ATE at the discontinuity, it actually identifies ATT at the discontinuity (very local!)*
